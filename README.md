# YOLO v3 Object Detection

This project implements YOLO v3 (You Only Look Once, version 3) for object detection. YOLO is a popular real-time object detection model that predicts both the objects in an image and their locations with a single pass through the model, making it efficient for real-time applications.

## Project Overview

The project leverages convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. YOLO's architecture enables it to detect multiple objects within an image while preserving high inference speed. Key aspects of this implementation include batch normalization, padding functions, and fixed hyperparameters for tuning performance.

## Setup and Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `Pillow` (for image processing)
- `seaborn` (for color management)
- `matplotlib`
- `cv2` (OpenCV for image processing)

Install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow seaborn matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Model Components

### 1. Batch Normalization
The batch normalization function stabilizes and accelerates training by normalizing activations. It maintains mean close to zero and variance close to one, improving convergence.

```python
def batch_norm(inputs, training, data_format):
    ...
```

### 2. Fixed Padding
Fixed padding is used to preserve spatial dimensions in the convolutional layers when kernel size reduces them. This step helps prevent information loss at the image boundaries.

```python
def fixed_padding(inputs, kernel_size, data_format):
    ...
```

## Hyperparameters

The model uses specific hyperparameters to optimize performance:
- **Batch Normalization Decay**: `_BATCH_NORM_DECAY = 0.9`
- **Batch Normalization Epsilon**: `_BATCH_NORM_EPSILON = 1e-05`
- **Leaky ReLU Alpha**: `_LEAKY_RELU = 0.1`
- **Anchors**: Predefined anchor boxes optimized for YOLO v3
- **Model Input Size**: `_MODEL_SIZE = (416, 416)`

## Training and Evaluation

Training and evaluation details are provided in the project. It includes code for:
- Configuring the model to recognize multiple objects in a single image.
- Defining metrics for assessing detection accuracy and speed.

## Usage

1. **Load Image**: Use an image with objects you wish to detect.
2. **Run YOLO Model**: The model will process the image and output bounding boxes with class labels for detected objects.
3. **Display Results**: Use `matplotlib` or OpenCV functions to visualize detections.

```python
# Example usage
# Load and prepare the image
image = Image.open("your_image.jpg")

# Run detection (assuming the model is set up and trained)
detections = model.detect(image)
model.display(detections)
```

## Results

Upon successful training and inference, the model outputs:
- **Bounding Boxes** around detected objects.
- **Class Labels** for each detected object.
